RTX routers only allow one session per SSH connection, making the current design non-functional.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n**Current Behavior:**\n- `SSHSessionPool` creates one persistent `ssh.Client` (connection)\n- Attempts to create multiple `ssh.Session` objects on that single connection\n- RTX routers reject additional sessions: `ssh: rejected: connect failed (open failed)`\n\n**Root Cause:**\n```go\n// ssh_session_pool.go: Pool holds one sshClient\ntype SSHSessionPool struct {\n    sshClient *ssh.Client  // Single connection - RTX only allows 1 session here\n    ...\n}\n\n// createSSHSession attempts to create new session on same connection\nfunc (p *SSHSessionPool) createSSHSession() (*PooledSSHSession, error) {\n    ws, err := newWorkingSession(p.sshClient)  // Fails on RTX after first session\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**RTX Router Limitation:**\n- SSH multiplexing (multiple channels on one TCP connection) is not supported\n- Each command execution requires its own TCP connection + SSH handshake\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis redesign directly enables the original goal of the ssh-session-pool-integration spec:\n- Eliminate SSH connection errors during Terraform operations\n- Reduce latency by reusing established connections\n- Support larger Terraform configurations without hitting RTX connection limits\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Connection-Based Pool\n\n**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want the provider to pool SSH connections (not sessions), so that connection reuse works with RTX routers.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the pool is initialized THEN it SHALL manage independent SSH connections (each with its own `ssh.Client`)\n2. WHEN a command is executed THEN the system SHALL acquire a connection from the pool, use its single session, and return the connection\n3. IF the pool has no available connections AND pool is at capacity THEN the system SHALL wait until a connection becomes available (with timeout)\n4. WHEN a connection is returned to the pool THEN it SHALL remain open for reuse (session already closed or kept idle)\n\n### Requirement 2: Connection Lifecycle Management\n\n**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want connections to be properly managed, so that resources are not leaked.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a connection is acquired THEN the system SHALL create a new session on that connection for command execution\n2. WHEN command execution completes THEN the system SHALL close the session but keep the connection open\n3. IF a connection fails THEN the system SHALL discard it and create a new one\n4. WHEN idle timeout is reached THEN the system SHALL close and remove idle connections\n\n### Requirement 3: Session State Management\n\n**User Story:** As a Terraform user managing RTX routers with admin passwords, I want admin authentication state to persist across commands on the same connection.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a session is created on an existing connection THEN the system SHALL track whether that connection has been authenticated as admin\n2. IF connection is already admin-authenticated THEN the new session SHALL inherit admin mode automatically\n3. WHEN a connection is returned to the pool THEN its admin state SHALL be preserved for the next acquisition\n\n### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility\n\n**User Story:** As an existing Terraform user, I want the provider to work seamlessly with the new pool design.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN using the redesigned pool THEN the `PooledExecutor` interface SHALL remain unchanged\n2. IF pool operations fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the cause\n3. WHEN the pool is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to `simpleExecutor` behavior\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Performance\n\n- Connection acquisition latency should be < 10ms when connections are available\n- Connection reuse should reduce overall terraform plan time by 50%+ for large configurations\n- Pool should support concurrent access without lock contention\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Failed connections must be detected and discarded\n- Connection loss during command execution must trigger retry with new connection\n- Pool state must remain consistent under concurrent access\n\n### Resource Management\n\n- Idle connections should be closed after configurable timeout (default: 5 minutes)\n- Maximum concurrent connections should be configurable (default: 2)\n- All connections must be properly closed when pool is destroyed\n",
