It solves the challenge of manually configuring and maintaining RTX router settings by providing declarative, version-controlled, and reproducible network configurations.\n\n## Target Users\n\n- **Network Administrators**: Managing enterprise networks with Yamaha RTX routers\n- **DevOps Engineers**: Integrating network infrastructure into CI/CD pipelines\n- **System Integrators**: Deploying consistent network configurations across multiple sites\n- **IT Teams in Japan**: Primary market where RTX routers are widely deployed\n\n### User Pain Points\n- Manual CLI configuration is error-prone and time-consuming\n- No version control for network configurations\n- Difficult to replicate configurations across environments\n- Lack of automation for network infrastructure changes\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **DHCP Management**: Create, update, and delete DHCP scopes and static bindings with full lifecycle management\n2. **Router Information Access**: Read-only data sources for system info, interfaces, and routing tables\n3. **Configuration Persistence**: Automatic saving of configurations to router's persistent memory\n4. **Import Support**: Import existing router configurations into Terraform state without recreation\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- Enable complete IaC management of Yamaha RTX router configurations\n- Reduce configuration errors through declarative definitions and validation\n- Support enterprise deployment patterns with proper state management\n- Provide seamless integration with existing Terraform workflows\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and acceptance tests for all resources\n- **Documentation**: Complete schema documentation and usage examples\n- **Reliability**: Stable SSH connections and proper error handling\n- **Adoption**: Usage in production environments for RTX router management\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Follow RTX CLI Semantics**: Mirror RTX router terminology and command patterns for familiarity\n2. **Fail Safely**: Validate configurations before applying; provide clear error messages\n3. **Leverage Existing Patterns**: Reuse established Terraform provider conventions and Go SSH infrastructure\n4. **Minimal Scope**: Only implement features that provide clear value for IaC management\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **CLI-based**: Standard Terraform CLI output and logging\n- **Debug Logging**: TF_LOG environment variable for detailed operation tracing\n- **State File**: Terraform state tracks all managed resources\n- **Plan Output**: Clear diff visualization before applying changes\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **Additional Resources**: VPN, firewall rules, QoS, VLAN configurations\n- **Data Sources**: More read-only access to router state (ARP table, NAT sessions)\n- **Multi-Router Support**: Manage multiple RTX routers from a single configuration\n- **Configuration Backup**: Export and restore complete router configurations\n",
