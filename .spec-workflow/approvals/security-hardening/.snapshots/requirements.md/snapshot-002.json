The focus is on practical, low-risk fixes that improve the security posture without breaking existing functionality.\n\n### Scope Decision\n\nThe following issues were **excluded** from this spec after evaluation:\n\n| Issue | Reason for Exclusion |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| Command injection in schedule.go | RTX CLI is not a shell - no command chaining possible (`;`, `&&`, `\\|\\|` have no effect). Users create their own Terraform configs. |\n| Test code hardcoded credentials | Test-only dummy data (`testpass`) with no production impact |\n| Password field validation | Requires RTX router specification research - separate investigation |\n| Race conditions | Mutex already implemented, no reported issues |\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis security hardening aligns with providing a production-ready Terraform provider that enterprise users can confidently deploy in their infrastructure management workflows.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: Sanitize Sensitive Data in Debug Logs\n\n**User Story:** As an infrastructure operator, I want sensitive data to be redacted from debug logs, so that authentication credentials are not exposed when troubleshooting.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a command containing `password` (case-insensitive) is logged THEN the system SHALL replace the command content with `[REDACTED - contains sensitive data]`\n2. WHEN a command containing `pre-shared-key` (case-insensitive) is logged THEN the system SHALL replace the command content with `[REDACTED - contains sensitive data]`\n3. WHEN a command containing `secret` (case-insensitive) is logged THEN the system SHALL replace the command content with `[REDACTED - contains sensitive data]`\n4. WHEN debug logging outputs password prompt responses THEN the system SHALL log only success/failure status, not the actual response content\n5. IF TF_LOG=DEBUG is enabled THEN sensitive credentials SHALL NOT appear in any log output\n\n### REQ-2: Warn Users About Insecure SSH Host Key Verification\n\n**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want to be warned when using insecure SSH settings, so that I can make informed decisions about my security posture.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN `skip_host_key_check` is set to `true` THEN the system SHALL log a WARNING message indicating the security risk\n2. WHEN no host key verification method is configured THEN the system SHALL log a WARNING message recommending `known_hosts_file` or `host_key` configuration\n3. IF `known_hosts_file` or `host_key` is configured THEN the system SHALL NOT log any host key warnings\n\n### REQ-3: Enhance .gitignore for Security Best Practices\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want sensitive file patterns to be excluded by default in .gitignore, so that credentials are not accidentally committed.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the repository is cloned THEN the .gitignore SHALL exclude `.env` and `.env.*` files\n2. WHEN the repository is cloned THEN the .gitignore SHALL exclude private key files (`*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`)\n3. WHEN the repository is cloned THEN the .gitignore SHALL exclude common credential files (`credentials.json`, `secrets.json`, `*secret*`)\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Log sanitization logic should be in a dedicated utility function\n- **Modular Design**: Sanitization patterns should be configurable/extensible\n- **Dependency Management**: No new external dependencies required\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Sanitization function should have a clear signature: `sanitizeForLog(input string) string`\n\n### Performance\n\n- Log sanitization SHOULD have O(n) complexity where n is the number of sensitive patterns\n- Sanitization SHOULD NOT add more than 1ms overhead per log operation\n\n### Security\n\n- Sensitive patterns MUST be checked case-insensitively\n- The sanitization function MUST be applied consistently across all command logging locations\n- WARNING messages MUST clearly communicate security risks without exposing sensitive details\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Log sanitization MUST NOT cause panics or crashes\n- Invalid input to sanitization function SHOULD return original input (fail-open for logging, fail-closed for security)\n\n### Usability\n\n- Warning messages SHOULD include actionable recommendations\n- Log output SHOULD remain useful for debugging (redaction message should indicate why)\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Changing default SSH host key verification behavior (breaking change for existing users)\n- Adding input validation for password fields (requires RTX specification research)\n- Modifying test code credentials (no security impact)\n",
