# rtx Provider



## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    rtx = {
      source  = "github.com/sh1/rtx"
      version = "~> 0.2"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the RTX Provider
provider "rtx" {
  host     = var.rtx_host
  username = var.rtx_username
  password = var.rtx_password
  port     = var.rtx_port
  timeout  = var.rtx_timeout
}

# RTX router system information
data "rtx_system_info" "router" {}

output "router_info" {
  value = {
    model            = data.rtx_system_info.router.model
    firmware_version = data.rtx_system_info.router.firmware_version
    uptime           = data.rtx_system_info.router.uptime
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `host` (String) The hostname or IP address of the RTX router. Can be set with RTX_HOST environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for RTX router authentication. Can be set with RTX_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `username` (String) Username for RTX router authentication. Can be set with RTX_USERNAME environment variable.

### Optional

- `admin_password` (String, Sensitive) Administrator password for RTX router configuration changes. If not set, uses the same as password. Can be set with RTX_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `known_hosts_file` (String) Path to known_hosts file for SSH host key verification. Defaults to ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Can be set with RTX_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE environment variable.
- `max_parallelism` (Number) Maximum number of concurrent operations. RTX routers support up to 8 simultaneous SSH connections, but lower values are more stable. Defaults to 4. Can be set with RTX_MAX_PARALLELISM environment variable.
- `port` (Number) SSH port for RTX router connection. Defaults to 22.
- `sftp_config_path` (String) SFTP path to the configuration file (e.g., /system/config0). If empty, the path will be auto-detected. Can be set with RTX_SFTP_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
- `skip_host_key_check` (Boolean) Skip SSH host key verification. WARNING: This is insecure and should only be used for testing. Can be set with RTX_SKIP_HOST_KEY_CHECK environment variable.
- `ssh_host_key` (String) SSH host public key for verification (base64 encoded). If unset, uses known_hosts_file. Can be set with RTX_SSH_HOST_KEY environment variable.
- `ssh_session_pool` (Block List, Max: 1) SSH session pool configuration for improved performance and state consistency. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ssh_session_pool))
- `timeout` (Number) Connection timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30.
- `use_sftp` (Boolean) Use SFTP-based configuration reading for faster bulk operations. Defaults to false. Can be set with RTX_USE_SFTP environment variable.

### Nested Schema for `ssh_session_pool`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable SSH session pooling. When enabled, SSH sessions are reused across operations, improving performance and preventing state drift. Defaults to true.
- `idle_timeout` (String) Duration after which idle sessions are closed. Uses Go duration format (e.g., '5m', '30s', '1h'). Defaults to '5m'.
- `max_sessions` (Number) Maximum number of concurrent SSH sessions in the pool. RTX routers typically support up to 8 SSH connections. Defaults to 2.
