# rtx_access_list_ip_dynamic (Resource)

Manages a named collection of IPv4 dynamic (stateful) IP filters on RTX routers.

Dynamic filters provide stateful packet inspection for various protocols. This resource groups multiple dynamic filter entries under a single name for easier management and reference.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic outbound stateful inspection for common protocols
resource "rtx_access_list_ip_dynamic" "outbound_stateful" {
  name = "outbound-stateful"

  entry {
    sequence    = 100
    source      = "*"
    destination = "*"
    protocol    = "www"
    syslog      = true
  }

  entry {
    sequence    = 101
    source      = "*"
    destination = "*"
    protocol    = "ftp"
  }

  entry {
    sequence    = 102
    source      = "*"
    destination = "*"
    protocol    = "dns"
    timeout     = 60
  }
}

# Reference from interface
resource "rtx_interface" "wan" {
  name = "lan2"

  ip_address {
    dhcp = true
  }

  access_list_ip_dynamic_out = rtx_access_list_ip_dynamic.outbound_stateful.name
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Access list name (identifier). Used to reference this access list from interface bindings.
- `entry` (Block List) List of dynamic filter entries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--entry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `entry`

Required:

- `sequence` (Number) Sequence number (determines order and filter number). Lower numbers are evaluated first.
- `source` (String) Source address or '*' for any. Can be an IP address, network in CIDR notation, or '*'.
- `destination` (String) Destination address or '*' for any. Can be an IP address, network in CIDR notation, or '*'.
- `protocol` (String) Protocol for stateful inspection. Valid values: `ftp`, `www`, `smtp`, `pop3`, `dns`, `domain`, `telnet`, `ssh`, `tcp`, `udp`, `*`, `tftp`, `submission`, `https`, `imap`, `imaps`, `pop3s`, `smtps`, `ldap`, `ldaps`, `bgp`, `sip`, `ipsec-nat-t`, `ntp`, `snmp`, `rtsp`, `h323`, `pptp`, `l2tp`, `ike`, `esp`.

Optional:

- `syslog` (Boolean) Enable syslog logging for this filter. Default: `false`.
- `timeout` (Number) Timeout value in seconds. If not specified, uses system default.

## Import

Import is supported using the access list name:

```shell
terraform import rtx_access_list_ip_dynamic.example outbound-stateful
```
