# rtx_interface (Resource)

Manages network interface configuration on RTX routers. This includes IP address assignment, security filters, NAT descriptors, and other interface-level settings.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# WAN interface with DHCP and security filters
resource "rtx_interface" "wan" {
  name        = "lan2"
  description = "WAN connection"

  ip_address {
    dhcp = true
  }

  secure_filter_in  = [200020, 200021, 200099]
  secure_filter_out = [200020, 200021, 200099]
  nat_descriptor    = 1000
}

# LAN interface with static IP
resource "rtx_interface" "lan" {
  name        = "lan1"
  description = "Internal LAN"

  ip_address {
    address = "192.168.1.1/24"
  }

  proxyarp = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Interface name (e.g., 'lan1', 'lan2', 'bridge1', 'pp1', 'tunnel1')

### Optional

- `description` (String) Interface description
- `dynamic_filter_out` (List of Number) Dynamic filter numbers for outbound stateful inspection.
- `ethernet_filter_in` (List of Number) Ethernet (L2) filter numbers to apply on inbound traffic. Order matters - first match wins.
- `ethernet_filter_out` (List of Number) Ethernet (L2) filter numbers to apply on outbound traffic. Order matters - first match wins.
- `ip_address` (Block List, Max: 1) IP address configuration block. Either 'address' or 'dhcp' must be set, but not both. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ip_address))
- `mtu` (Number) Maximum Transmission Unit size. Set to 0 to use the default MTU.
- `nat_descriptor` (Number) NAT descriptor ID to bind to this interface. Use rtx_nat_masquerade or rtx_nat_static to define the descriptor.
- `proxyarp` (Boolean) Enable ProxyARP on this interface
- `secure_filter_in` (List of Number) Inbound security filter numbers. Order matters - first match wins.
- `secure_filter_out` (List of Number) Outbound security filter numbers. Order matters - first match wins.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `interface_name` (String) The interface name. Same as 'name', provided for consistency with other resources.

<a id="nestedblock--ip_address"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ip_address`

Optional:

- `address` (String) Static IP address in CIDR notation (e.g., '192.168.1.1/24')
- `dhcp` (Boolean) Use DHCP for IP address assignment
