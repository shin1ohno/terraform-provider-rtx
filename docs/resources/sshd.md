# rtx_sshd (Resource)

Manages SSH daemon (sshd) configuration on RTX routers. This is a singleton resource - only one instance should exist per router. WARNING: Disabling SSH while connected via SSH may lock you out of remote management. Ensure you have alternative access (console, telnet) before disabling SSH.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Enable SSH service on all interfaces
resource "rtx_sshd" "ssh_access" {
  enabled = true
}

# Enable SSH restricted to specific interfaces
# resource "rtx_sshd" "secure_ssh" {
#   enabled = true
#   hosts   = ["lan1", "lan2"]
# }
```

### Optional

- `auth_method` (String) SSH authentication method: password, publickey, or any (default).
- `hosts` (List of String) List of interfaces to listen on. If empty, listens on all interfaces when enabled.
