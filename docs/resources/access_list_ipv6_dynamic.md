# rtx_access_list_ipv6_dynamic (Resource)

Manages a named collection of IPv6 dynamic (stateful) filters on RTX routers.

Dynamic filters provide stateful packet inspection for various protocols. This resource groups
multiple dynamic IPv6 filter entries under a single name for easier management and reference.

Note: Unlike IPv4 dynamic filters, IPv6 dynamic filters do NOT support the timeout attribute.

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Access list name (identifier).

### Optional

- `entry` (Block List) List of dynamic IPv6 filter entries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry))
- `sequence_start` (Number) Starting sequence number for automatic sequence calculation. When set, sequence numbers are automatically assigned to entries based on their definition order.
- `sequence_step` (Number) Increment value for automatic sequence calculation. Only used when sequence_start is set. Default is 10.

### Nested Schema for `entry`

Required:

- `source` (String) Source IPv6 address or '*' for any. Can be an IPv6 address, network in CIDR notation, or '*'.

Optional:

- `sequence` (Number) Sequence number (determines order and filter number). Required in manual mode, auto-calculated when sequence_start is set.
- `syslog` (Boolean) Enable syslog logging for this filter.
