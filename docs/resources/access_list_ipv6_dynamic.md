# rtx_access_list_ipv6_dynamic (Resource)

Manages a named collection of IPv6 dynamic (stateful) filters on RTX routers.

Dynamic filters provide stateful packet inspection for various protocols. This resource groups
multiple dynamic IPv6 filter entries under a single name for easier management and reference.

Note: Unlike IPv4 dynamic filters, IPv6 dynamic filters do NOT support the timeout attribute.

```hcl
resource "rtx_access_list_ipv6_dynamic" "outbound_stateful" {
  name = "outbound-stateful-ipv6"

  entry {
    sequence    = 100
    source      = "*"
    destination = "*"
    protocol    = "www"
    syslog      = true
  }

  entry {
    sequence    = 101
    source      = "*"
    destination = "*"
    protocol    = "ftp"
  }

  entry {
    sequence    = 102
    source      = "*"
    destination = "*"
    protocol    = "dns"
  }
}
```
