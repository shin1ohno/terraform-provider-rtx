# rtx_access_list_mac (Resource)

Manages MAC address access lists on RTX routers. MAC ACLs filter traffic based on source and destination MAC addresses. Supports automatic sequence numbering (auto mode) or manual sequence assignment.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `entry` (Block List, Min: 1) List of MAC ACL entries (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry))
- `name` (String) Access list name (identifier)

### Optional

- `apply` (Block List) List of interface bindings. Each apply block binds this ACL to an interface in a specific direction. Multiple apply blocks are supported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--apply))
- `filter_id` (Number) Optional RTX filter ID to enable numeric ethernet filter mode. If not specified, derived from first entry.
- `sequence_start` (Number) Starting sequence number for automatic sequence calculation. When set, sequence numbers are automatically assigned to entries based on their definition order. Mutually exclusive with entry-level sequence attributes.
- `sequence_step` (Number) Increment value for automatic sequence calculation. Only used when sequence_start is set. Default is 10.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

### Nested Schema for `entry`

Required:

- `ace_action` (String) Action to take (permit/deny or RTX pass/reject with log/nolog)

Optional:

- `byte_list` (List of String) Byte list (hex) for offset matching
- `destination_address` (String) Destination MAC address (e.g., 00:00:00:00:00:00)
- `destination_address_mask` (String) Destination MAC wildcard mask
- `destination_any` (Boolean) Match any destination MAC address
- `dhcp_match` (Block List, Max: 1) DHCP-based match settings (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry--dhcp_match))
- `ether_type` (String) Ethernet type (e.g., 0x0800 for IPv4, 0x0806 for ARP)
- `filter_id` (Number) Explicit filter number for this entry (overrides sequence)
- `log` (Boolean) Enable logging for this entry
- `offset` (Number) Offset for byte matching
- `sequence` (Number) Sequence number (determines order of evaluation). Required in manual mode (when sequence_start is not set). Auto-calculated in auto mode (when sequence_start is set).
- `source_address` (String) Source MAC address (e.g., 00:00:00:00:00:00)
- `source_address_mask` (String) Source MAC wildcard mask
- `source_any` (Boolean) Match any source MAC address
- `vlan_id` (Number) VLAN ID to match

<a id="nestedblock--entry--dhcp_match"></a>
### Nested Schema for `entry.dhcp_match`

Required:

- `type` (String) DHCP match type (dhcp-bind or dhcp-not-bind)

Optional:

- `scope` (Number) DHCP scope number



<a id="nestedblock--apply"></a>
### Nested Schema for `apply`

Required:

- `direction` (String) Direction to apply filters (in or out)
- `interface` (String) Interface to apply filters (e.g., lan1, bridge1). MAC ACLs cannot be applied to PP or Tunnel interfaces.

Optional:

- `filter_ids` (List of Number) Specific filter IDs (sequence numbers) to apply in order. If omitted, all entry sequences are applied in order.
