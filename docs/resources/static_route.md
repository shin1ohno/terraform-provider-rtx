# rtx_static_route (Resource)

Manages static routes on RTX routers. A static route defines a fixed path for network traffic to reach a specific destination network.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Default route through a gateway
resource "rtx_static_route" "default" {
  prefix = "0.0.0.0"
  mask   = "0.0.0.0"

  next_hop {
    gateway  = "192.168.0.1"
    distance = 1
  }
}

# Network route to 10.0.0.0/8 via gateway
resource "rtx_static_route" "private" {
  prefix = "10.0.0.0"
  mask   = "255.0.0.0"

  next_hop {
    gateway  = "192.168.1.1"
    distance = 1
  }
}

# Route through PPPoE interface with failover
resource "rtx_static_route" "internet" {
  prefix = "0.0.0.0"
  mask   = "0.0.0.0"

  # Primary: PPPoE connection
  next_hop {
    interface = "pp 1"
    distance  = 1
    permanent = true
  }

  # Backup: Secondary gateway
  next_hop {
    gateway  = "192.168.0.254"
    distance = 10
  }
}

# VPN tunnel route
resource "rtx_static_route" "vpn" {
  prefix = "192.168.100.0"
  mask   = "255.255.255.0"

  next_hop {
    interface = "tunnel 1"
    distance  = 1
    permanent = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `mask` (String) The subnet mask in dotted decimal notation (e.g., '255.255.255.0').
- `prefix` (String) The destination network prefix (e.g., '10.0.0.0' for a network, '0.0.0.0' for default route).

### Optional

- `next_hop` (Block List) Next hop configuration for this route. Multiple next hops enable load balancing or failover. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--next_hop))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource identifier in the format 'prefix/mask'.

<a id="nestedblock--next_hop"></a>
### Nested Schema for `next_hop`

Optional:

- `distance` (Number) Administrative distance (weight). Lower values are preferred. Range: 1-100. Defaults to router default if not specified.
- `filter` (Number) IP filter number to apply to this route. 0 means no filter. Defaults to router default if not specified.
- `gateway` (String) Next hop gateway IP address (e.g., '192.168.1.1'). Either gateway or interface must be specified.
- `interface` (String) Outgoing interface (e.g., 'pp 1', 'tunnel 1'). Either gateway or interface must be specified.
- `permanent` (Boolean) Keep route even when next hop is unreachable (keepalive). Defaults to router default if not specified.
