# rtx_bgp (Resource)

Manages BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) configuration on RTX routers. BGP is a singleton resource - only one BGP configuration can exist per router.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# BGP configuration with iBGP and eBGP neighbors
resource "rtx_bgp" "main" {
  asn       = "65001"
  router_id = "10.0.0.1"

  log_neighbor_changes = true

  # iBGP neighbor (same AS)
  neighbor {
    index     = 1
    ip        = "10.0.0.2"
    remote_as = "65001"
    keepalive = 30
    hold_time = 90
  }

  # eBGP neighbor (different AS)
  neighbor {
    index     = 2
    ip        = "203.0.113.2"
    remote_as = "65002"
    keepalive = 60
    hold_time = 180
  }

  # Advertise networks
  network {
    prefix = "192.168.0.0"
    mask   = "255.255.255.0"
  }

  redistribute_static    = true
  redistribute_connected = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `asn` (String) Autonomous System Number (1-4294967295). Supports 4-byte ASN.

### Optional

- `default_ipv4_unicast` (Boolean) Enable IPv4 unicast address family by default for new neighbors.
- `log_neighbor_changes` (Boolean) Log neighbor up/down changes.
- `neighbor` (Block List) BGP neighbor configurations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--neighbor))
- `network` (Block List) Networks to announce via BGP. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--network))
- `redistribute_connected` (Boolean) Redistribute connected routes into BGP.
- `redistribute_static` (Boolean) Redistribute static routes into BGP.
- `router_id` (String) BGP router ID in IPv4 address format. If not set, uses the highest loopback or interface IP.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource identifier. Always 'bgp' for this singleton resource.
