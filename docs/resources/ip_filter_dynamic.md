# rtx_ip_filter_dynamic (Resource)

Manages an IPv4 dynamic (stateful) IP filter on RTX routers.

Dynamic filters provide stateful packet inspection for various protocols. Two forms are supported:

**Form 1 (Protocol-based):** Specify source, destination, and protocol for stateful inspection.
```hcl
resource "rtx_ip_filter_dynamic" "http" {
  filter_id   = 100
  source      = "*"
  destination = "*"
  protocol    = "www"
  syslog      = true
}
```

**Form 2 (Filter-reference):** Reference other static IP filters for complex rules.
```hcl
resource "rtx_ip_filter_dynamic" "custom" {
  filter_id       = 200
  source          = "*"
  destination     = "*"
  filter_list     = [1000, 1001]
  in_filter_list  = [2000]
  out_filter_list = [3000]
}
```
