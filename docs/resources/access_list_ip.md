# rtx_access_list_ip (Resource)

Manages a group of IPv4 static filters (access list) on RTX routers. This resource manages multiple IP filter rules as a single group using the RTX native 'ip filter' command. Supports automatic sequence numbering or manual sequence assignment.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) ACL group identifier. This name is used to reference the ACL in other resources and for Terraform state management.

### Optional

- `apply` (Block List) List of interface bindings. Each apply block binds this ACL to an interface in a specific direction. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--apply))
- `entry` (Block List) List of IP filter entries. Each entry defines a single filter rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry))
- `sequence_start` (Number) Starting sequence number for automatic sequence calculation. When set, sequence numbers are automatically assigned to entries based on their definition order. Mutually exclusive with entry-level sequence attributes.
- `sequence_step` (Number) Increment value for automatic sequence calculation. Only used when sequence_start is set. Default is 10.

### Nested Schema for `apply`

Required:

- `direction` (String) Direction to apply the ACL: 'in' for incoming traffic, 'out' for outgoing traffic.
- `interface` (String) Interface to apply the ACL to (e.g., lan1, bridge1, pp1, tunnel1).

Optional:

- `dynamic_filter_ids` (List of Number) Dynamic filter IDs to apply. These are appended after the 'dynamic' keyword in the secure filter command.
- `filter_ids` (List of Number) Specific filter IDs (sequence numbers) to apply in order. If omitted, all entry sequences are applied in order.


<a id="nestedblock--entry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `entry`

Required:

- `action` (String) Filter action: pass, reject, restrict, or restrict-log
- `destination` (String) Destination IP address/network in CIDR notation (e.g., '192.168.1.0/24') or '*' for any
- `source` (String) Source IP address/network in CIDR notation (e.g., '10.0.0.0/8') or '*' for any

Optional:

- `dest_port` (String) Destination port number, range (e.g., '80'), or '*' for any. Only valid for TCP/UDP.
- `established` (Boolean) Match established TCP connections only. Only valid for TCP protocol.
- `log` (Boolean) Enable logging when this entry matches traffic.
- `protocol` (String) Protocol: tcp, udp, icmp, ip, gre, esp, ah, or * for any
- `sequence` (Number) Sequence number determines the order of evaluation. Required when sequence_start is not set (manual mode). Auto-calculated when sequence_start is set (auto mode).
- `source_port` (String) Source port number, range (e.g., '1024-65535'), or '*' for any. Only valid for TCP/UDP.
