# rtx_access_list_extended (Resource)

Manages IPv4 extended access lists (ACLs) on RTX routers. Extended ACLs provide granular control over packet filtering based on source/destination addresses, protocols, and ports. Supports both manual sequence mode (explicit sequence on each entry) and auto sequence mode (sequence_start + sequence_step). Optional apply blocks bind the ACL to interfaces.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the access list (used as identifier).

### Optional

- `apply` (Block List) List of interface bindings. Each apply block binds this ACL to an interface in a specific direction. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--apply))
- `entry` (Block List) List of ACL entries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--entry))
- `sequence_start` (Number) Starting sequence number for automatic sequence calculation. When set, sequence numbers are automatically assigned to entries based on their definition order. Mutually exclusive with entry-level sequence attributes.
- `sequence_step` (Number) Increment value for automatic sequence calculation. Only used when sequence_start is set. Default is 10.

### Nested Schema for `apply`

Required:

- `direction` (String) Direction to apply the ACL: 'in' for incoming traffic, 'out' for outgoing traffic.
- `interface` (String) Interface to apply the ACL to (e.g., lan1, bridge1, pp1, tunnel1).

Optional:

- `sequences` (List of Number) Sequence numbers to apply in order. If omitted, all entry sequences are applied in order.


<a id="nestedblock--entry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `entry`

Required:

- `ace_rule_action` (String) Action: 'permit' or 'deny'.
- `ace_rule_protocol` (String) Protocol: tcp, udp, icmp, ip, gre, esp, ah, or *.

Optional:

- `destination_any` (Boolean) Match any destination address.
- `destination_port_equal` (String) Destination port equals (e.g., '80', '443').
- `destination_port_range` (String) Destination port range (e.g., '1024-65535').
- `destination_prefix` (String) Destination IP address (e.g., '10.0.0.0').
- `destination_prefix_mask` (String) Destination wildcard mask (e.g., '0.0.0.255').
- `established` (Boolean) Match established TCP connections (ACK or RST flag set).
- `log` (Boolean) Enable logging for this entry.
- `sequence` (Number) Sequence number (determines order). Required in manual mode (when sequence_start is not set). Auto-calculated in auto mode.
- `source_any` (Boolean) Match any source address.
- `source_port_equal` (String) Source port equals (e.g., '80', '443').
- `source_port_range` (String) Source port range (e.g., '1024-65535').
- `source_prefix` (String) Source IP address (e.g., '192.168.1.0').
- `source_prefix_mask` (String) Source wildcard mask (e.g., '0.0.0.255').
